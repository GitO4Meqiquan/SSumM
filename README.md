# SSumM: Sparse Summarization of Massive Graphs
Source code for the paper [SSumM: Sparse Summarization of Massive Graphs](), Kyuhan Lee*, Hyeonsoo Jo*, Jihoon Ko, Sungsu Lim, Kijung Shin, KDD 2020.

**SSumM** (**S**parse **Sum**marization of **M**assive Graphs) is a scalable and effective graph summarization algorithm that yields a sparse summary graph. Compared to its state-of-the-art competitors, **SSumM** has the following advantages:
* *Concise*: yields up to 11.2X smaller summary graphs with similar reconstruction error
* *Accurate*: achieves up to 4.2X smaller reconstruction error with similarly concise outputs
* *Scalable*: summarizies 26X larger graphs while exhibiting linear scalability
