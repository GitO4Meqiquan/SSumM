 SSumM is a scalable and effective graph summarization algorithm that yields a sparse summary graph.
 SSumM has the following advantages:
 - Concise: yields up to 11.2× smaller summary graphs with similar reconstruction error.
 - Accurate: achieves up to 4.2× smaller reconstruction error with similarly concise outputs.
 - Scalable: summarizes 26× larger graphs while exhibiting linear scalability.
