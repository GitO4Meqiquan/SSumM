SSumM is a scalable and effective graph summarization algorithm that yields a sparse summary graph.
SSumM has the following advantages:
- Concise: yields up to 11.2× smaller summary graphs with similar reconstruction error.
- Accurate: achieves up to 4.2× smaller reconstruction error with similarly concise outputs.
- Scalable: summarizes 26× larger graphs while exhibiting linear scalability.
